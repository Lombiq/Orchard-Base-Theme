## Training sections


This module doesn't cover Orchard Core basics. Instead, sometimes we reference the [Lombiq Training Demo for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module) which does. The [Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions) repository includes both the Training Demo and this project.

If you need help with setting up SCSS compilation, read the documentation of [Lombiq Gulp Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Gulp-Extensions/#gulp-tasks) first. Also check out the [Gulpfile.js](Gulpfile.js) and [package.json](package.json) files in this project.

You can start with any of the top-level sections, but the indented sections should be followed in sequence. 

- Make a custom theme
  - [Configuration](Manifest.cs)
  - [Layout injection](Views/Widget-LayoutInjection.cshtml)
  - [Sass styling and structure](Assets/Styles/site.scss)
- [Front-end navigation via the `"main"` menu](Services/AccountNavigationProvider.cs)
