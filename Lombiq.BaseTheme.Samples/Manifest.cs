    // A base theme is another theme project. Orchard Core Display Management first searches your theme and then the
    // base theme for template alternates. Besides that, it's similar to a dependency in modules, so any services

// Steps you need to do outside of this project:
// - Reference the project in your web app.
// - Enable the "Lombiq.BaseTheme.Samples" feature in your setup recipe.
// - Set the site theme to "Lombiq.BaseTheme.Samples" in your setup recipe.
// - Run the "Lombiq.BaseTheme.LayersAndZones" recipe from your setup recipe.
// You can see these in the "Lombiq.OSOCE.Web.csproj" and the "Lombiq.OSOCE.Tests.recipe.json" files in the
// https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions/ repository.
