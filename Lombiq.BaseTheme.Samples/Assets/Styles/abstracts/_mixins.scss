// You can reference "Assets/Styles/abstracts/_variables.scss" here once and then you never have to again. Other .scss
// files can import this one to have everything. Make sure to import "variables" before the Base Theme's "mixins",
// because that imports some default Sass variable declarations and you want them to override your custom values.
@import "variables";

// Note for Visual Studio users: Sass resolves the @import "../Lombiq.BaseTheme/Assets/Styles/abstracts/mixins"; below,
// but VS does not. Looks like Sass supports path lookup where the path root (sometimes referred to as ".") is the
// working directory (so the project directory where the package.json file is), while VS only supports paths relative to
// the current scss file's location. If you have trouble with it, you can replace the below line with
// @import "../../../../Lombiq.BaseTheme/Assets/Styles/abstracts/mixins"; which both support. VS doesn't support paths
// starting with "~" either (https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Intellisense-not-working-in-sassscss-fi/33481)
// and you can't use IntelliSense to resolve paths outside of your current project directory using either format.
@import "../Lombiq.BaseTheme/Assets/Styles/abstracts/mixins";

// In this case we create a mixin that crops a media field into a nice wide banner. It's applied both for sites and blog
// posts in other files.
@mixin media-field-banner {
    // The "mixins" file in the Lombiq.BaseTheme has several utility mixins, including many "gutter" functions that help
    // with applying uniform spacing between controls on your web site. Unless you have a specific reason not to, we
    // suggest always using these to set gap (for grid and flexbox), margin and padding.
    @include margin-bottom-gutter($multiplier: 1);

    img {
        height: var(--height-header);
        width: 100%;
        object-fit: cover;
    }

    .name { display: none; }
}
