@* Use shape overriding to include your theme files here which should import Assets/Styles/site.scss. Use the
   Model.LayoutModel to access the Model of Layout.cshtml. This is rendered prior to the <resources> tag helper so you
   can still add resources like the Site style below. If you need to add inline styles or scripts, make sure to include
   them as resources too, so they can be rendered after their dependencies. *@

<style asp-name="@ResourceNames.Site"></style>
